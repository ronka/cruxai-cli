# Description
Detects when the vast majority of requests are concentrated in a single workspace, missing opportunities to use AI across projects.

# When Triggered
{{pct}} of all requests ({{count}}/{{total}}) are in "{{extra.topWorkspace}}". Copilot can help across all your projects.

# How to Improve
Try using Copilot in other workspaces too. It can help with documentation, testing, DevOps, and exploratory coding across your entire workflow.

# Examples
{{extra.workspace}}: {{extra.reqCount}} requests ({{extra.reqPct}}%)

# Detection Logic
```detect
scan: sessions
match: true
aggregate: count
top: groupTopBySum(allSessions, "workspaceName", "requestCount")
reqTotal: sumField(allSessions, "requestCount")
emitCount: top.sum
emitTotal: reqTotal
topWorkspace: top.key
check: top.share > thresholds.maxTopRate AND top.sum >= thresholds.minReqs AND top.count >= thresholds.minWorkspaces
```
