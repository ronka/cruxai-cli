# Description
Detects a high rate of cancelled requests, which wastes premium quota and indicates unclear prompting.

# When Triggered
{{count}} of {{total}} requests cancelled ({{pct}}). This wastes premium quota.

# How to Improve
Write clearer, more specific prompts. Wait for responses instead of cancelling prematurely.

# Examples
"{{message}}..."

# Detection Logic
```detect
scan: requests
match: isCanceled == true
aggregate: ratio
check: ratio > thresholds.maxCancelRate
examples: "{{messageText | clip:80}}"
```
