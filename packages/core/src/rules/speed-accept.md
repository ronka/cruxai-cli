# Description
Detects instances where the next message was sent within seconds of receiving large AI code blocks, indicating no time for review.

# When Triggered
{{count}} times you sent the next message within {{extra.maxGapSec}}s of receiving {{extra.minAiLoc}}+ lines of AI code (avg {{extra.avgLoc}} LOC, avg {{extra.avgGap}}s gap). Not enough time to review.

# How to Improve
Take time to read AI-generated code before moving on. Review for correctness, security issues, and edge cases. A quick glance is not a review.

# Examples
{{extra.workspace}}: {{extra.aiLoc}} AI LOC, {{extra.gapSec}}s gap -> "{{message}}..."

# Detection Logic
```detect
scan: sessions
match: requestCount >= 2
aggregate: count
pairs: adjacentPairCount(allSessions, thresholds.minAiLoc, thresholds.maxGapMs)
emitCount: pairs.count
emitTotal: count
avgLoc: pairs.avgLoc
avgGap: pairs.avgGap
maxGapSec: round(thresholds.maxGapMs / 1000)
minAiLoc: thresholds.minAiLoc
check: pairs.count >= thresholds.minOccurrences
examples: {{workspaceName}}: speed-accept detected
```
